Contributing to Caldwell
========================

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this document is to show you how to contribute to the project.

This document assumes that you are keeping your git repositories in a directory in your
home directory.

### Install Node.js

Using homebrew, install the **`nodejs`** package. As of the writing of this document, **`5.3.0`**
is being used.

```bash
brew install nodejs
```

### Install Electron

Electron is the Node.js framework used to provide a UI to the application. Install it into the local
*`node_modules`* directory in your repository (don't worry, this is ignored by `.gitignore`).

```bash
npm install 
```
